Hello file by fprintf over_write...
This is the Main for testing ft_printf

TEST 1: %c CHAR
We will pass the char A by variable :a
Now we pass the char by declaration :b
Watch as I pass the char by integer :C
we will pass the value by function  :d
The next thing is field width       :    E!
Now we will left align our output   :F    !

TEST 2: %s STRINGS
Please enter your :Username
Pass string by    :words
Test field width  :      Field is?!
Now left-alignment:On the left?   !
Check precision to:Shorte         !
th is a string
   th is a string

TEST 3: %d & %i Decimals & Integers
Width(10) and precision( 5):	|     04242|
Width( 4) and precision(15):	|000000000000042|
Width(05) and precision( 0):	|00042|
Width( 5) and precision( 0):	|   42|
Int min test (long): -2147483648
Long max test (long long): 9223372036854775807

TEST 4: %o Octals
Octal| Width(-5) & precision(10):	|0000004704|
Octal| Width(10) & precision( 5):	|04704     |
Octal| Width(-05) & precision( ):	|4704 |
Octal| Width( 6) with hash & -  :	|04704 |

TEST 5: %u Unsigned Int

This is a float number test -5452.365000
This is a float L number test -5452.365457
This is a float precision test 452.365

TEST 8: %b Binary
The binary for  5 is 101
The binary for 42 is 101010
The binary for 42 is 101010
The binary for 42 is 101011110000

TEST 9: %p Pointers
The memory address of 'my_ui is = 0X7FFDF192BEF0
The memory address of 'my_float' is = 0X7FFDF192BEF4
The memory address of 'my_double' is = 0x7ffdf192bf08
The memory address of 'my_char "a"' is = 0X7FFDF192BEEF
And finally the address of 'str' is 0x7ffdf192bf00
